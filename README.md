## Description of files

- **GTen_la_langue_musicale.md**: a Google Translated (and modified by myself; still contains simple errors of translation) version of the original French document of La Langue Musicale. It is almost complete.
- **incomplete_en_la_langue_musicale.md**: A 'properly' translated version of the original French document of La Langue Musicale, as well as descriptions of each picture. My translation comes from my knowledge of French (a beginner) and my knowledge of the language (and what it should say) from other sources. It is not even close to complete.
