The "Music Language" by proclaiming your name,
In the midst of the fights the cannon is talking.

La "Langue Musicale" en proclamant ton nom,
Au milieu des combats fait parler le canon.

Introduction
Explanation of the work and syntax

  All men who have dealt with linguistics know the immense number of languages spread over the whole surface of the earth.
  We talk about it, we say, 3064:
587 in Europe; - 937 in Asia; - 276 in Africa; - 1264 in America.
  It is therefore not surprising that in ancient times, as in modern times, the search for elements of a language that could become universal.
  Busy for forty-five years on this important question, I always thought that the problem could only be solved with the help of musical notes, since the universality of the sign, its figurative uniformity, the ease of to write it, to pronounce it, to indicate it on the fingers, and to render it appreciable by touch, made of this five-fold means of communication the language most suited to universality.

II

  By the universal word I do not mean that it is intended to replace any of the existing languages, it was never my thought. We will always learn the different languages to know the scientific, poetic and literary works of different peoples; but in this respect what is happening today, even among the most civilized nations?
  A few hundred people learn one or two foreign languages, and twenty or thirty million only know their mother tongue; well! it is these millions of individuals that I had in mind when I thought of creating a language that could be common to them all.
  It will thus serve as a general trucheman, like Latin in the Middle Ages, with this difference, that instead of requiring three or four years of study, it will take three or four months.
  Nature gives all men sufficient intelligence so that in all circumstances he can make himself understood by his fellow man, sometimes even without any other help than that of gesture, all the more so if he is given an easy means of express by well-defined signs all the needs of life.
  I have thus contained all the ideas in the seven notes of the music; I have stressed them by combinations that are easy to remember, and I have formed a language accessible to all the intelligences and all the peoples of the world.
  It is not a translation of the French language that must be sought in this work, since ideas belong to the domain of all languages.
  The synonyms used are not generally those used. The idea alone is expressed and not the exact nuances. However, to give thought a greater extension, or to restrict it, it possesses two signs which determine four distinct shades.

III

  Fasi, placed before the attribute, is the augmentative;
  Fasi, after the attribute, becomes the superlative. Sifa, placed before the attribute, expresses the diminutive, and sifa, after the attribute, restricts even more the expression of the idea.
  This language, in spite of its narrow sphere, embraces all the physical and moral relations of man with his fellow man.
  No doubt it does not have the richness of idioms which possess a great number of syllables, but the seven who constitute it render it by this very correct, abbreviative, simple, easy to learn, to pronounce, to write, and, by the its many applications, it has advantages that no other can offer.
  In the first place, instead of scattering ideas, she groups them together in groups, so that a single combination of notes reproduces the whole family of a word at the same time.

Example:
[sirelasi]
Constitute
Constitution
Constitutionally
Component
Constitutional

  Seeing thus united the verb, the substantive, thing, the substantive relative to the man, the adjective and the adverb, one might doubt the safety of the transmission of the idea; but the syntax, of which I will speak a moment ago, employs to make them recognize the simplest means.

IV

  To the word generator I have added all the expressions which follow from it, and, by preceding it or following it by the augmentative sign or the diminutive sign, it will be easy to choose in this group the term which will seem the most suitable. The sentence can then take a different turn without ever altering the idea originally stated.
  If, to render one thought, one word comes to mind rather than another, using the alphabetical dictionary, and taking the musical notation that represents that word, that notation will always mean the generating idea that found at the head of each group in the Ideographic Dictionary.
  Moreover, all the ideas are linked, in order of action, much more than in a rigorously logical order, because, the generation of ideas varying according to the different idioms, it would have been impossible to reunite them logically for all peoples, while that the actions being the same in all countries, especially in the century in which we are, the study of this language will be less abstract, more attractive, and above all much easier.

V

  This language consists of binary, ternary combinations, and makes use of seven keys containing quaternary combinations.
  First part (single notes),
Specially dedicated to words whose need is felt most often.
  Clef of Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La and Si.

Binary combinations are devoted to small words, the most common particles and pronouns.
  The ternary combinations of the 1st and 2nd parts are devoted to the words most often used.
  The key of Do belongs to the physical and moral man, to his intellectual faculties, his qualities, and his food;
  Re's key to toiletries, to those contained in a house, to housework and to the family.
  The key of Mi to the actions of the man and his faults;
  The key of the Fa to the country, to travel, to war, and to the navy;
  The key of Sol to the fine arts and sciences;
  La key to industry and commerce;
  The key of Si to the city, the government and the administration.

VI

Second part (repeated notes),
  The continuation of the key of Do is devoted to religion, the beginning of which is found in the Do of the ternary combinations (of the first part) destined for divinity;
  That of Re to the construction and the various trades;
  That of Mi to prepositions, adverbial phrases, and isolated adverbs;
  Those of Fa and Sol to different diseases;
  That of La to industry and commerce (continuation of the La of the first part);
  That of Si to justice, the judiciary and the courts (continuation of the Si of the first part).

The third part (four-part combinations) contains the three kingdoms of nature, the kingdoms: animal, vegetable, and mineral.

  This language offers a peculiarity that does not exist in any other, the possibility of expressing the opposite of thought by the inverse of the sign of this thought.

Examples:
  God; domisol (perfect match)
  Satan; solmido
  The good; misol
  The evil; solmi

VII

  Ascend; sollasi
  Descend; silasol

  As we see, the opposite movement of which we make use in harmony here receives an application of the happiest. It follows from this manner of proceeding that five hundred words give the knowledge of a thousand.

Syntax
From the article (“de l’article”)

  The musical language does not admit an elision (the omission of a letter or syllable), the article remains invariable; the cases, for the indirect regimen (indirect object), are indicated by the prepositions to and from (“à et de”).

Application:
  The nominative article and the accusative article are represented by the same musical sign.
Singular masculine and feminine.

Nominative or subject,
Accusative or direct regime,
Masculine: la
Feminine: la-a

VIII

Dative or indirect regime (“... indirect à le”),
Masculine: fa
Feminine: fa-a

Genitive or indirect regime of the, (... regime “du ou de le”),
Ablative or indirect regime of the, (... regime “du ou de le”),
Masculine: lasi
Feminine: lasi-i

  As we can see, Universal Language represents only three cases.
  The two genera are applicable only to the two sexes and to distinguish, in animals, the male from the female.

Examples:
  Man: la domifado
  Woman: la-a domifado
  Horse: la faresoldo
  Mare: la-a faresoldo

  All material objects and moral things have only one genre: the masculine.
  As we see, the feminine differs from the masculine, in writing, by a small bar placed above the article or the particle.

IX

  When the feminine noun is isolated, the last note composing it takes the sign of the deminer, as follows:

Examples:
  Woman: domifado-o
  Girl: resireso-ol

  In speaking, it suffices to repeat the last letter of the musical syllable, as in the preceding examples.

Plural
  Nominative and accusative: the (“les”): la’ / lla
  Dative: to the (“à les”): fa’ / ffa
  Genitive and ablative: of the (“des”): lasi’ / lassi

  As we see, the plural differs from the singular, in writing, by an accent placed either on the article, on the last note of the particle, or on the last note of the substantive when it is isolated.
  In speaking, it is enough to double by the accentuation the note which represents the article, or the last note of the particle.

X

Examples:
  Plural masculine: lla (la’)
    pronounce it as if there were two L
  Plural masculine: la ssi (lasi’)
  Plural feminine: lla-a (la’-a)
  Plural feminine: la ssi-i (lasi’-i)

  In the musical language, where words of all kinds retain their primitive form, all declination is by means of prepositions: from or to (“de ou à”), as a, a (“un, une”), subject or direct regime, to one (“à un”), to one (“à une”), to a (“d’un”), of an (“d’une”), indirect regime.
  One (“un”) expressing at the same time unity/unitary (“unité”), unique/only, secondly (“unièmement”), it serves, like the other words, substantive, adjective and adverb, by employing in order to make them recognize the absolute rule of which I will speak just now.

Partitive meaning
  To express the partitive meaning, that is to say, an indeterminate quantity of a thing, the musical language, as well as the English and German languages, does not admit partitive articles or adjectives.

Examples:
  That it (“voilà”) wine and beer: mila dolaresi re dosifare
  The enemy has a lot of troops: s^idomi famisol famifarre fami [should be fasi?]

XI

From the noun or name (“DU SUBSTANTIF ou NOM”)
  All nouns or common nouns, without exception, mark the plural signs only when they are isolated from the article or particle.

  Wonders: dofassol (dofaso’l) (“merveilles”)
  Wonders: dofalla (dofal’a) (“prodiges”)
  Present: remilla (remil’a) (“présents”)
  Crowns: silarre (silar’e) (“couronnes”)

  I said above that the verb, the substantive relating to things, the substantive applicable to the man and the adverb are represented by the same musical combination. Here is the way to designate them.

Example:
  Constitute: sirelasi, nothing for the verb
  Constitution: s^irelasi
  Component: sir^elasi
  Constitutional: sirel^asi
  Constitutionally: sirelas^i

  Speaking, it will be enough to rinforzando in the pronunciation of the marked note of the sign.

XII

From the adjective (“de l’adjectif”)
  I said above that it is invariable and should always follow the noun.

Degrees of comparison
  The degrees of comparison are formed as in French, those of superiority by: more (“plus”), the most (“le plus”), and those of inferiority by: less (“moins”), the least (“le moins”).
  There are some irregular forms in the degree of comparison as good, better, bad, worse (“bon, meillèur, mauvais, pire”).
  Instead of better, the Musical Language says: more good; instead of worse, she says: more worse (bad).

Personal pronouns
  I, me, or me, myself; (“Je, me, ou moi, moi-même”)
  You, you, or you, yourself; (“Tu, te, ou toi, toi-même”)
  He or he, himself; (“Il ou lui, lui-même”)
  Se or self, oneself (“Se ou soi, soi-même”)

Expressed by the following combinations:
  I: dore
  You: domi
  He/she: dofa
  Self: dosol
 
  Indirect regimes are always placed after the verb (“me à moi, te à toi, se à soi”)

XIII

Examples:
  I propose myself; Musical language: Me, propose to me;
  You propose yourself; Musical language: You, propose to you;
  He proposes himself; Musical language: Him, to propose to oneself

  This way of proceeding also applies to the plural pronoun of the first person, us (“nous”); from the second, you (“vous”); and of the third, they or they (“ils ou eux”); which will be determined, as we have already seen by other examples, by the emphasis placed on the last note.
  The feminine, for the direct regime she (“elle”) or indirect regime to her, of her (“à elle, d’elle”), will be expressed likewise by the bar placed on the last note.

Example:
She: dofa-a
Theirs: doffa-a (dof’a-a)

Relative pronoun “en” (“du pronom relatif en”) [en = genitive (of) pronoun 3p]
  In (“en”) is used only in front of verbs or substantives.

Examples:
  Consciousness warns us as a friend (“La conscience nous avertit en ami”); - I do not like it angry (“Je ne l’aime pas en colère”); - Speaking of him (“En parlant de lui”).
  The musical language puts this relative pronoun in use only in this dual sense, and never when it means in French the pronouns to the indirect regime, of him, of her, of them, of this, of that.

XIV

Examples:
  Give me (“Donnez-m’en”); Musical language: Give me that (“Donnez à moi de cela”).
  I have to complain about it (“J’ai à m’en plaindre”); Musical language: Me having to complain about him or her (“Moi avoir à plaindre moi de lui ou d’elle”).

From the pronoun "y" [y = locative (at) pronoun 3p]
  Y relating to people expresses itself in the musical language by the personal pronoun.
  He thinks of me, I hardly think about it; Musical language: To think of him, to think little about him.
(“Il pense à moi, je n'y pense guère; …: Lui penser à moi, moi penser peu à lui”)
  When "y" is relative to things, it is expressed as "that".

Example:
  I count on it (“J’y compte”); Musical language: I rely on that (“Moi compter sur cela”).

  When it is used as an adverb of place, the musical language renders it by the adverbs of which it is the representative, such as: there, here, inside, in, near, above, below
  (“... la Langue musicale le rend par les adverbes dont y est le représentant, tels que: là, ici, dedans, là-dedans, auprès, dessus, dessous”).

Examples:
  Here we are: We're here (“Nous y sommes: Nous être là”)
  She's here: She's here. (“Elle y est: Elle être ici”)

"He" (“Il”)
  He (“il”), subject of impersonal verbs, as well as he (“il”) relating to an abstract thing, is always suppressed.

XV

Examples:
  It is beautiful to be esteemed: To be beautiful to be esteemed. (“Il est beau d'être estimé: Être beau d'être estimé”)
  You have to leave: Have to leave (“Il faut partir: Falloir partir”)



From the pronoun "the, the, the" (“le, la, les”)
  The pronoun (“le”) is always replaced by him (“lui”) or her (“elle”) for people, and by that (“cela”) for things.

Examples:
  Your brother is great and mine is not; Musical language: Your brother's great being, and mine, him (“lui”), not be that;
(“Votre frère est grand et le mien ne l'est pas; Langue musicale: Tien frère grand être, et mien, lui, pas être cela”)
  Your coat is beautiful and mine is not; You dress well, and do not be that (“cela”).
(“Votre habit est beau et le mien ne l'est pas; Tien habit beau être, et mien pas être cela.”)

Possessive pronouns, adjectives
  My, my, mine, mine: redo (“mon, ma, le mien, la mienne”)
  Your, your, yours, yours: remi (“ton, ta, tien, la tienne”)
  His, his, his, hers: refa (“son, sa, le sien, la sienne”)
  Our, to us, to several: resol (“notre, à nous, à plusieurs”)
  Your, to you, to several: rela (“votre, à vous, à plusieurs”)
  Their, to you, to several: resi (“leur, à vous, à plusieurs”)

XVI

Absolute possessive pronouns. [no need to worry if you speak English]
  Absolute possessive pronouns, mine, mine (“le mien, la mienne”), etc., are often replaced in French by the pronouns personal to me, to you, to him (“à moi, à toi, à lui”), etc. The Musical Language always uses possessive pronouns adjectively.

Examples:
  This garden is mine (“Ce jardin est à moi”); Musical language: This garden is mine (“Cet jardin être mien”).
  The house is ours (“La maison est à nous”); Musical language: The house is our (“La maison être notre”).

Demonstrative pronouns
  This, this, this, this, this one, this one (“Ce, cet, cette, ceci, celui-ci, celle-ci”): fami
  This, this, this, this, that, that, that one (“Ce, cet, cette, cela, celui-là, celle-là”): fare

  When he or she (“celui or celle”), representing people, will be followed by the relative pronoun which, it will always be necessary to put: The person instead of the pronoun.

Examples:
  He who (“Celui qui”) loves his neighbor is loved by God; Musical language: The person who loves his neighbor to be loved by God; (“Celui qui aime son prochain est aimé de dieu; Langue musicale: La personne que aimer son prochain être aimer de Dieu”)
  God protects those who (“ceux qui”) obey his law; Musical language: God protect people who observe his law. (“Dieu protége ceux qui observent sa loi; Langue musicale: Dieu protéger les personnes qui observer sa loi”)

XVII

Relative pronouns
  Who, what, which, which, which, which: mire (“qui, que, lequel, laquelle, lesquels, lesquelles”)

Examples:
  The man you are looking for; Musical language: The man who you seek. (“L’homme que vous cherchez; Langue musicale: Le homme lequel vous chercher”)
  The thought that you have; Musical Language: The thought which you have. (“La pensée que vous avez; …: La pensée laquelle vous avoir”)

  The indirect regime to which, to which, etc., is formed by adding "fa" to "mire".

Example:
  Fa mire;
Whose, to which
(“fa: à, au-”)
(“mire: qui, -quel”)

  The rule is the same to distinguish the feminine and the plural.

  "WHAT" means in musical language "which thing" (“QUOI signifie en langue musicale laquelle chose”)

  Fado: what? Which thing? (“quoi? Laquelle chose?”)

  That's what you do not think about; Musical language: That's what you do not think about. (“C'est à quoi vous ne pensez pas; … : Cela être laquelle chose toi non penser.”)
  The musical language, as well as the Greek, Latin languages, etc., does not admit the addressed to you one person, it says you or you. (“etc., ... n'admet pas le vous adressé une seule personne, elle dit tu ou toi.”)

XVIII

Indefinite pronouns
  We (“On”). This indefinite personal pronoun taken in an unlimited sense is common to almost every language; the musical Language joins it to someone, another, the next:
  (“; … la Langue musicale le joint à quelqu'un, autrui, le prochain”)

Dola - One, someone, others, the next (“On, quelqu'un, autrui, le prochain”)



[In the] musical language:
  This has been said; (“On a dit cela”)
  Someone have to say that; (“Quelqu'un avoir dire cela”)
  Others have said that; (“Autrui avoir dire cela”)
  The next one to say that. (“Le prochain avoir dire cela.”)

  Dola famisol mirefado fare
[one/someone have/own say that]
  We have to say that (“On avoir dire cela”)

  Each or every (“chacun ou chaque”): sire; is applicable to people as to things.
  Other/another (“autre”): resi; is also applicable to people as to things. [should be dosi?]
  “Nobody” doesn’t exist as a pronoun in the musical language; if we wanted to say this sentence:
Pride does not suit anyone; (“L’orgueil ne convient à personne”)
We would add: to no one. (“L’on ajouterait:... à personne aucun”)
  Nothing (“rien”): soldo; significant, in the musical language, nothingness, null, no, not one, she uses it as much as an indefinite pronoun as a noun and adjective, by applying the rule adopted to distinguish the noun from the adjective.

XIX

Verbes
  The study of the verbs, in the various languages, seems to present more difficulties than all the parts of the discourse: one by their nature as active, passive, neutral, reflective, reciprocal, or pronominal: the others by their regular, irregular conjugations or defective; others, finally, by their combination with particles or prepositions which, according to the language or the grammatical mode, are sometimes separable, sometimes inseparable from the verb whose meaning they modify. The musical language is not concerned with knowing whether the verb is active, neutral, transitive or intransitive; it is not hindered by the difficulties that exist in other languages.
  It therefore constantly represents the verb in the form of the infinitive. The different times [tenses] are indicated by as distinctive and invariable signs, always preceding the infinitive of the verb which we want to express the time [tense], mode [/mood] or one of the participles.
  The sign is constantly the same for all persons or singular & plural which are sufficiently indicated by personal pronouns.

  These signs are as follows:
Dodo: imperfect and definite past
    These two times are constantly represented in the other languages sounds the same form.
Rere: pluperfect indicative and subjunctive
Mimi: future
Fafa: conditional
Solsol: imperative
Lala: present participle
Sisi: past participle
    This sign is only used when separated/isolated from its auxiliary. (to be, to have, etc.)

XX

  For the present of the indicative and the subjunctive, the infinitive of the verb is only used. The compound times [tenses] are indicated by the auxiliaries “being” and “having”.

Observation
  “Have to” (falloir), an impersonal verb in French, is personal in other languages. It often happens that the musical language also uses it as a personal verb.

Example:
  I must go to Rome; I have to go to Rome

  As we have just seen, the syntax of the musical language is extremely simple; for all the difficulties of which most of the syntaxes of the various languages are bristling disappear in this one.
  If I add that the musical language does not have spelling; that his writing, formed of a single sign, is the exact painting of the sound of the voice; that his pronunciation being contained in the seven monosyllables: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, permits all foreigners to pronounce this language as distinctly as we, after a few minutes of study; that, moreover, it furnishes a common language to beings hitherto deprived of the possibility of understanding each other, that is to say, the blind and the deaf-mute; and that being based on a universal principle, music, expressing the ideas that are universal, it will be invariable by its nature and durable like the ideas themselves, I will finish by saying that, by its simplicity, the musical language is accessible to all intelligences, and being doubly universal, it belongs, by its nature, to all the peoples of the earth.

F. Sudre

  Note. When, in a family of ideas, there is one which seems to interrupt the logical order, it is because the musical notation and often the opposite sense imposed the necessity of giving it this place.
XXII

  Proper names, city names, street names and technical terms are expressed by phonetic means derived from an alphabet.

Phonetic Alphabet

  By assembling the consonants with the vowels, all the possible syllables will be formed, and the sound of these syllables will be invariable in all the idioms.

XXIII

  When the consonants are joined, either to the vowels "a, e, i, o, u", or together, they lose a part of their value, that is to say that the letter e, which belongs to them when they are isolated, disappears when they are together.
  The consonants preceded by a point are expressed speaking by the rinforzando of the note.           
  Those represented by blacks will have to be doubled, in other words, repeated. Thus, for example, we say: Do do, re re, mi mi, fa fa, and so on.
  Those that are also black and preceded by a point will be repeated by adding the rinforzando on the first note, as follows:
    D Do-do, R Re-re, F Fa-fa, etc.

Differences in how to write syllables.
  The syllable "ai" is represented not "é" as in "café" (/ka.fe/), because "ai" would mean, in the Musical Language, "a-i", as in "hai".
  The syllable "aine", as in “aubaine” (/o.bɛn/), is replaced by "éne", as in Hélène (/e.lɛn/). "Aine", in Langue musicale, would be pronounced "a-ine".
  The syllable "au", often represented in French by the vowel o, as in the words autocratie (/o.tɔ.kʁa.si/), Autriche (/o.tʁiʃ/), always retains the sound of this vowel o; one will write thus "otocratie", "Otriche", because "au" is pronounced, in Musical Language, "a-u", like in the word "ahuri" (/a.y.ʁi/), and it is written: "auri".
  We have, in French, four ways of writing the sound an, am, en, em, as in the words below: Angleterre (/ɑ̃.ɡlə.tɛʁ/), ambassadeur (/ɑ̃.ba.sa.dœʁ/), encore (/ɑ̃.kɔʁ/), empire (/ɑ̃.piʁ/). 

XXIV

The musical language represents this sound only in one way: an. She writes: Angletére, anbasadeure, ancore, anpire.
  The syllable “en” (/ɑ̃/) is transformed, in French, into that of in (“d’in”)(/ɛ̃/?), when it represents the words: sien (/sjɛ̃/), rien (/ʁjɛ̃/), lien (/ljɛ̃/).
  The musical language admits it (“en”) only under this last meaning. Thus, she writes: sen instead of saint (/sɛ̃/); Jermen, instead of Germain (/ʒɛʁ.mɛ̃/). It is the same for the words fin (/fɛ̃/), lin (/lɛ̃/), which are written by fen, len.
  The syllable "in" (/ɛ̃/?), in French, is always "ine" for the musical language, as in "fine" (/fin/), Malines (/ma.lin/), Aggripine.
  The "c" is always "hard" and can never replace the sound of the s, as in “Sicile” (/si.sil/); but as in coque (/kɔk/), cabane (/ka.ban/); that one will have to write: koke, kabane; and not as in Cendrillon (Cinderella, from “cendre” /sɑ̃dʁ/), that Sandrion must be written. 
  When the “i” can represent the pronunciation of the two "ll", as in the word Cendrillon, it will be necessary to remove them. (example: grenouille /ɡʁə.nuj/, juillet /ʒɥi.jɛ/, taille /taj/)
  The s is always hard: therefore, the use of both ss is never necessary. We write therefore: Pruse, Rusi, and not Prusse (/pʁys/), Russie (/ʁy.si/).
  The t never replaces the s, as in the word suprématie (/sy.pʁe.ma.si/), which will have to be written supremasi. It will be invariable, as in Pontoise, that we will write Pontoize, because the soft s will be replaced by the z.
  The u always keeps the sound that it expresses in the personal pronoun tu (/ty/).

  Première partie - First part
Clef de DO
  Devoted to the physical and moral man, his intellectual faculties, his qualities, and his food.
(Consacrée à l'homme physique & moral, à ses facultés intellectuelles, à ses qualités, et à son alimentation.)

  This key and the following contain words under which others are placed which do not derive from the same family, although part of the generating idea.
(Cette clef et les suivantés contiennent des mots sous lesquels en sont placés d'autres qui ne dérivent pas de même famille, quoique faisant partie de l'idée génératrice.)

  The rule, to make them understand, is the same as the one which is indicated in the syntax to distinguish the "verb" from the "noun", from the "adjective" and from the "adverb"
(La règle, pour les faire comprendre, est la même que le qui est indiquée dans la syntaxe pour distinguer le "verbe" du "substantif", de l'"adjectif" et de l'"adverbe".)

  That is to say, you must "press/support while speaking" on the first note following the word generator; on the second note for the second word; on the third note for the third word, and on the fourth note for the fourth word.
(C'est-à-dire il faut "appuyer en parlant" sur la première note qui suit le mot générateur; sur la seconde note pour le deuxième mot; sur la troisième note pour le troisième mot, et sur la quatrième note pour le quatrième mot.)


  Première partie - First part

  Devoted to the actions of man & to his faults.
(Consacrée aux actions de l'homme & à ses défauts.)

  Deuxième partie - Second part
Combinations Ternaires - Ternary combinations
  Dedicated to seasons, months, numbers, temperature.
(Consacrées aux saisons, aux mois, aux nombres, à la température.)

Note
  I could have placed here the third part of the ideographic dictionary; but, since it is exclusively devoted to the three kingdoms: "animal, vegetal, and mineral," it is useless to learn it by heart.
(J'aurais pu placer ici la troisième partie du Dictionnaire idéographique; mais, comme elle est exclusivement consacrée aux trois règnes: "animal, végétal et minéral", il est inutile de l'apprendre par coeur.)

  It is enough when you want to use any of the words it contains, to seek in this part of the dictionary, which combinations can amount to "nine thousand and sixty-seven" which will enrich the language of words whose novelty might make it necessary to feel.
(Il suffira, quand on voudra se servir de l'un des mots qu'elle renferme, de le chercher dans cette partie du Dictionnaire, dont les combinaisons peuvent s'élever à "neuf mille soixante-sept", ce qui permettra d'enrichir la langue de mots dont la nouveauté des choses pourrait faire sentir la nécessité.)

  I could have also placed in this edition the "usual phrases" contained in the "four Vocabularies" accompanied the "eight Dictionaries exposed in London in 1862".
(J'aurais pu également placer dans cette édition les "phrases usuelles" contenues dans les "quatre Vocabulaires" accompagnaient les "huit Dictionnaires exposés à Londres en 1862".)

  Very often M. (Mr.) Sudre and I have experimented in public with this very abbreviating manner of communicating thought, which consists in not signaling, in a sentence, that the "word" representing the "subject".
(Bien souvent M. Sudre et moi avons expérimenté en public cette manière très-abréviative de communiquer la pensée, et qui consiste à ne signaler, dans une phrase, que le "mot" représentant le "sujet".)

For example: (Ainsi, par exemple:)
  Is your "health" good? - Redofafa?
(Votre "santè" est-elle bonne?)

  Will you go to the "campaign/countryside" this year? - Fadoremi? [fadoremi = country]
(Irez-vous à la "campagne" cette année?)

  Will you go to the “theater” tonight? - Soldoremi? [soldoremi = theatre]
(Irez-vous au "théàtre” ce soir?)

  These sentences, all "interrogative" become "affirmative", adding to the musical combination the sign of the personal pronoun "I" or "me" - dore:
(Ces phrases, toutes "interrogatives", deviennent "affirmatives", en ajoutant à la combinaison musicale le signe du pronom personnel "je" ou "moi", dore:)

  My "health" is good: - Redofafa dore
(Ma "santé" est bonne:)

  I will go to the "countryside" this year: - Fadoremi dore
(J'irai à la "campagne" cette année:)

  I'll go to "theater" tonight: - soldoremi dore
(J'irai au "théàtre" ce soir:)

  These collections of sentences for so many years composed by M(r). Sudre, will be attached to the next edition if the need is noticeable, because it is only through the practice of a language that we can form a just opinion of the things that are useful to him.
(Ces recueils de phrases depuis tant d'années composés par M. Sudre, seront joints à l'édition prochain si toutefois la nécessité s'en fait remarquer, car ce n'est que par la pratique d'une langue que l'on peut former une juste opinion des choses qui lui sont utiles.)

  The following Alphabetical Dictionary and the one relating to the three kingdoms of nature; refer to the ideographic dictionary, divided into three parts, to find, "joined to a family of ideas", the word you want to search.
(Le Dictionnaire alphabétique suivant et celui qui est relatif aux trois règnes de la nature; renvoient au Dictionnaire idéographique, divisé en trois parties, pour trouver, "reuni à une famille d'idées", le mot que l'on veut y chercher.)

  The combinations of notes written in syllables in the two alphabetical dictionaries are only the translation of the notes written in music in the ideographic dictionary.
(Les combinaisons de notes écrites en syllabes dans les deux Dictionnaires alphabétiques ne sont que la traduction des notes écrites en musique dans le Dictionnaire idéographique.)

  The first row of these numbers indicates the pages of the Ideographic Dictionary, the second row indicates the columns of these pages, and the third row the rows of these columns
(La première rangée de ces chiffres désigne les pages du Dictionnaire idéographique, la seconde rangée indique les colonnes de ces pages, et la troisième rangée les lignes de ces colonnes.)
