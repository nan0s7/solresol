Universal musical language
By the means of which
(after only three months of study)
All [the] different people of the Earth
[the] deaf, [the] blind & [the] mutes
Can understand each other
Language at the same time spoken, written, occult/hidden & silent (signed)
Invented by
F. Sudre
And approved by l’Institut de France (the Institute of France)
“...He needed a universal language to express a universal opinion:
God created [the] music”
A. Berton (encyclopedic dictionary of Coartin?, Voir?/see [for] the word Musique?/music)
(could be E. Berton, and Coartin has only been found as Courtin so far)
“[the] languages [themselves] share/divide the world: [the] music is one for all the Earth”
L’abbé d’Olivet
(Pierre-Joseph Thoulier d’Olivet)
This language has formed seven signs from [the] music of whose/which [the] universality may not be placed in doubt, and it is not necessary to be [a] musician in order to [the] learn.

It is spoken, when someone pronounces the notes: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si.
It is written, when these same notes are drawn on [the] paper as hereinafter (as follows):
(the seven notes from middle-c to a are written in ascending order on a treble clef staff)
It is unspoken, when the notes are pointed to on [the] fingers, as [it] follows:
(the left hand shows the pointing finger bent, being held by the thumb, with si on the extended middle finger, la halfway up the finger length, but in-between the middle and ring fingers, sol on the extended ring finger, fa half-way and in-between the ring and pinky fingers, mi on the extended pinkie finger, re halfway up the pinkie finger, and do on the underside/bottom of the hand, directly under the pinkie finger. The right hand is pointing to the finger on the left hand with the syllable that you wish to convey)
Finally it is occult/hidden, when the deaf-mute, by a slight pressure, makes him recognise [to] the blind [person] with which/whom they want [oneself/themself] to [be] put in touch {with}.
Through this short explanation, one sees evidently that all [the] men of the Earth, at that same time that the majority [of] among them could be deaf, blind or mute, find in this new language a means to [provide] communicate their ideas.
